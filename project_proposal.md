# Project Proposal - Circles

#### Description:



#### Justification:

There are currently tens, if not hundreds, of messaging apps available on the App Store. Unfortunately, most of these apps, especially the leaders in the market, are either very simple apps with limited functionality, or are overloaded with functionality. The former tends to be used by close friends for casual use, where the extra functionality becomes heavy and tedious to use. The latter is used by organizations and companies who are looking to better organize themselves.

In our experience, people tend to default towards using a plain and simple messaging application, such as Ios's built in Messages, Facebook's Messenger, or WhatsApp, even though applications like Discord and Slack can heavily improve quality of life when trying to follow conversations, especially in groups. In fact, there are tons of very useful tools that could improve one's messaging experience. 

The goal of Circles is to create one such messaging app that has a fair balance between functionality and ease of use. It will be a challenge to find the perfect balance
