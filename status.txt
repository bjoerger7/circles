Spent most of today stressing out and discussing the database structure, as well as the multiple facets and difficulties in making a full messaging mobile application.

Brian
- research Pub / Sub functionality
- research notification structure (note: would we need a notifications table)
- become familiar with Rust
- make ERD and upload to GitHub

Eddie
- iOS file system - caching chats locally (how??)
- look into cognito - make sure it's free
- become familiar with Ionic - build something
