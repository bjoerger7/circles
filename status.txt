Spent most of today stressing out and discussing the database structure, as well as the multiple facets and difficulties in making a full messaging mobile application.

Brian
- research Pub / Sub functionality
- research notification structure (note: would we need a notifications table)
- become familiar with Rust
- make ERD and upload to GitHub

Eddie
- iOS file system - caching chats locally (how??)
- look into cognito - make sure it's free
- become familiar with Ionic - build something

Spent most of today implementing the first draft of our mock-ups using moqup.com. During this time, we made decisions on many of our flows and general application ideas. We decided that messages will not be stored on the phone for our MVP (most likely) and also discussed what information will be retrieved on startup.

Some decisions that we made since the last meeting: we will be using Go for our backend, Brian is in love with GraphQL so we will be using it, Eddie was researching Ionic but is on the verge of deciding to use React Native.

Brian
- research backend architecture (microservice vs. monolithic)
- research notification structure (note: would we need a notifications table)
- research long-polling, open-socket, firebase, and bananas

Eddie
- decide (don't be cheap) between Ionic and React Native
- look into Cognito - make sure it's free

Next time we will begin setup for backend.

Continued mock-ups using moqup.com. During this time, we made decisions on many of our flows and general application ideas, and talked about possible future directions to take with Circles.


----- 2/12/19 -----
Completed our Software Requirements Specification. Then, we began to layout or code base and asked for advice from colleagues.

Brian
- look into GraphQL more and try to play around with it

Eddie
- look into Apollo GraphQL and typescript for react-natice

Next time we will begin setup for backend.

----- 2/21/19 -----
Initiated the front end application (react-native with typescript). Also set up file structure and began setting up app navigation using react-navigation.

Found great examples (with go-graphql, postgres/sqlx, go) on GitHub to learn how to properly structure a backend with such a stack.

Brian
- take what you learned from examples, documentation, and experiments and create a draft of the backend.

Eddie
- set up react navigation
- create two pages and navigate between.

----- 2/26/19 -----
Eddie explained Front End file structure to Brian. Brian explained Backend file structure to Eddie. 

Eddie
- Stop slacking and actually begin to work on components
- Find ways around not having endpoints
