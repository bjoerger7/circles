This is a GREAT job, and I can see that there are a lot of things you
have thought through with this project..

You can ALWAYS specify more.  Try to think in terms of "if someone else
were to code this project, what would they need to know about the way it
operates?  What information could I provide them so they can be successful
in the implementation?

Try to be as specific and detailed as possible.  For example, requirement
5.3.4 what are the settings?  You can make a bullet list and use a "will"
statement underneath 5.3.4 to say what they are:

5.3.4 Mobile Application shall allow users to edit notification settings
      for given chats and circles.
      Notification settings will include but are not limited to:
        * setting 1
        * setting 2
          ....
        * setting N

Watch out for "weasel words" like "properly" in 5.3.8 or "effectively"
in 5.3.7, or even "securely" in 5.3.7.  Those are VERY hard to prove,
because they are a subjective judgement not a measurable value.

Otherwise, nice work!  Make a few additions and changes and you'll be
good to go!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 14.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              27.18 out of 28.18 points = 96.45% which is an A

Keep it up!
