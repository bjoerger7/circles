# Project Proposal - Circles

#### Description:

Circles is a messaging app that will have a fair balance between functionality and ease of use. The most central idea behind our app that separates it from other messaging apps is our lightweight and intuitive take on chats, both group and individual. The leading messaging apps either have very organized and functional group chats, such as Discord, or limit their functionality and organization, such as iOS's Messages. Circles will organize chats into circles in a way that makes it feel as simple as standard messaging apps with the functionality seamlessly tagged on. With this approach, Circles will have a more welcoming and pleasing design that encourages users to experiment with functionality rather than shy away from it. There are multiple other pieces of functionality that we plan to add, such as customizable user profiles and flexible notification settings, but these ideas are still in the works.

#### Justification:

There are currently tens, if not hundreds, of messaging apps available on the App Store. Unfortunately, most of these apps, especially the leaders in the market, are either very simple apps with limited functionality, or are overloaded with functionality. The former tends to be used by close friends for casual use, where the extra functionality becomes heavy and tedious to use. The latter is used by organizations and companies who are looking to better organize themselves. In our experience, people tend to default towards using a plain and simple messaging application, such as iOS's built in Messages, Facebook's Messenger, or WhatsApp, even though applications like Discord and Slack can heavily improve quality of life when trying to follow conversations, especially in groups. In fact, there are tons of very useful tools that could improve one's messaging experience. Circles will be a very welcome addition to the messaging application family.

In creating this application from the ground up, we will gain major experience in all parts mobile application development. Although we have experience in backend and frontend respectively, there are several important concepts and technologies at play that we have not yet been personally exposed to. Since we intend to make the best design decisions we can, we will need to learn about countless such concepts and technologies as we go.
